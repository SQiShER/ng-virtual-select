A Angular directive for the [Virtual Select](https://github.com/SQiShER/virtual-select) UI component.

# Current state
Virtual Select started out as an Angular directive. But due to its nature I stripped more and more Angular away until I ended up with a simple jQuery plugin (which could probably be even more reduced to vanilla DOM). The separation of the jQuery and the Angular repositories is still work in progress, so please don't expect production-ready stability or feature completion just yet.
